# PyBer_Analysis

### Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis: 

### The Purpose.

In this report, we wanted to find the total rides, total drivers along with the average fares per ride and drivers. After computing all of the information, we were able to then find the total fare by city type on a weekly basis from January to early May of 2019. Once we gathered the numbers, we utilized Matplotlib to create a stunning line graph to tell the weekly fares by city summary.  

## Results: 

Using the chart below we can see some major differences between the different city types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. For starters Rural city fares were the highest per ride and drivers but they also had the least amount of total rides and drivers. They were also significantly lower in total fares. 

On the other side of the spectrum, analyzing the Urban numbers, the average fare per ride and driver were the lowest, however, they had the highest amount of total rides, total drivers with their total fares amount bringing in the majority of the profit. Last but not least, the Suburban city type sits right in the middle of Urban and Rural when it comes to the averages  and total numbers.

If we analyze the numbers and chart below, we can clearly see that the Urban city type wins every category with being the highest per weekly fare amounts. Suburban city types coming in a close second. And Rural being last.

## Summary: 

### Three Recommendations.

In summary, I would recommend adding more support for Pyber's Rural drivers. In doing so, this will hopefully allow more drivers to sign up and bring in more revenue by being more available for customers. Second, I may lower the fares for the Suburban and Rural city types. With fares being lowered, customers may start riding more since it will be more reasonable for them. Lastly, Pyber could try raising the Urban city type fares to make up the difference in lowering the prices for Suburban and Rural cities. In general, customers are more willing to take a ride within the Urban area so they do not have to deal with things like parking and finding their own way around the city. Raising the prices will help bring in more revenue for the company.
